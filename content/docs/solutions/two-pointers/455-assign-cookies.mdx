# 455. Assign Cookies â€“ Easy

## ðŸ§¾ Description

You are given two integer arrays:

- `greed[]`: the greed factor of each child.
- `cookies[]`: the size of each cookie.

You want to assign cookies to children such that each child receives **at most one** cookie, and the cookie must have a size **greater than or equal to** the child's greed factor.

Your goal is to maximize the number of content children.

### Example

```ts
// Expected: 1
findContentChildren([1, 2, 3], [1, 1])

// Expected: 2
findContentChildren([1, 2], [1, 2, 3])
```

## Objective

Assign cookies to as many children as possible such that each child gets a cookie that satisfies their greed. Each cookie can be used only once.

Return the maximum number of content children.

### Approach

This is a greedy algorithm problem.

### Intuition

To maximize the number of content children, we should try to satisfy the least greedy children first with the smallest available cookies.

### Code

```ts title="455. Assign Cookies"
export const findContentChildren = (greed: number[], cookies: number[]): number => {
  let idxGreed = 0
  let idxCookies = 0
  const n = greed.length
  const m = cookies.length
  let countContentChildren = 0
  greed.sort((x, y) => x - y)
  cookies.sort((x, y) => x - y)
  while (idxGreed < n && idxCookies < m) {
    if (cookies[idxCookies] >= greed[idxGreed]) {
      idxGreed++
      idxCookies++
      countContentChildren++
    } else {
      idxCookies++
    }
  }
  return countContentChildren
}
```

| Time Complexity      | Space Complexity |

| O(n log n + m log m) | O(1)             |
