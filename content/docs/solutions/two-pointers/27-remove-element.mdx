# 27. Remove Element â€“ Easy

## ðŸ§¾ Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove **all occurrences** of `val` **in-place**. The relative order of the remaining elements may change. Return the number of elements that are **not equal to `val`**.

You must achieve this with **O(1)** extra memory.

### Example

````ts
// Expected output: 2 (array becomes [2, 2, _, _])
removeElement([3, 2, 2, 3], 3)

// Expected output: 5 (array becomes [0, 1, 4, 0, 3, _, _, _])
removeElement([0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2], 2)


## Objective

Transform the input array so that the first k elements contain the values from the original array that are not equal to val. The values beyond k are irrelevant and can be ignored. Return k.

## Approach

This is a two-pointer pattern problem, common when working with in-place modifications.

### Intuition

We iterate through the array and selectively keep the values that are not equal to val by moving them to the front of the array. Since the relative order does not matter, this can be done efficiently by overwriting the original array as we go.

We use two pointers:

- index â†’ Track the position to place the next different values (initialized at 0)
- i â†’ Iterates through the array from left to right (starting at 0).

For each element at index i, if nums[i] !== val, we assign it to nums[index], and increment index. This way, all valid elements are moved to the beginning of the array.

### Visualization

We continue this way until we reach the end of the array.

### Code

```ts
export const removeElement = (nums: number[], val: number): number => {
    const n = nums.length
    let index = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== val) {
            nums[index++] = nums[i]
        }
    }
    return index
}

### Time Complexity

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(n)            | O(1)             |
