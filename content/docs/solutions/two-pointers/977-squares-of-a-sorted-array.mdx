# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array â€“ Easy

## Description

Given an array of integers `nums` **sorted in non-decreasing order**, return a new array consisting of the **squares** of each number, also **sorted in non-decreasing order**.

[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/)

### Example

```ts
// Expected: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]
sortedSquares([-4, -1, 0, 3, 10])

// Expected: [4, 9, 9, 49, 121]
sortedSquares([-7, -3, 2, 3, 11])
```

## Objective

Transform the input array by squaring each number and returning a sorted array of those squares.

## Approach

This is a two-pointer problem that takes advantage of the fact that the input array is already sorted.

### Intuition

Squaring negative numbers results in positive values. The largest square values will come from the elements with the largest absolute values, which are either at the start (negative) or end (positive) of the array.

To maintain sorted order, we fill a result array from the end to the beginning, always placing the largest square at the current position.

### Strategy

- Use two pointers: left = 0, right = n - 1.
- Compare |nums[left]| and |nums[right]|.
- Square the larger of the two and place it at the current position index in the result array.
- Move pointers and index accordingly.
- Continue until all elements are processed.

### Code

```ts title="977. Squares of a Sorted Array"
export const sortedSquares = (nums: number[]): number[] => {
  const n = nums.length
  let left = 0
  let right = n - 1
  let index = n - 1
  const sorted = Array.from<number>({ length: n }).fill(0)
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    const leftValue = nums[left] * nums[left]
    const rightValue = nums[right] * nums[right]
    if (rightValue > leftValue) {
      sorted[index] = rightValue
      right--
    } else {
      sorted[index] = leftValue
      left++
    }
    index--
  }
  return sorted
}
```

### Time Complexity

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(n)            | O(n)             |
