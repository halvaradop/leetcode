| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| --------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| nums      | number[] | The array of scores.              |
| k         | number   | The number of students to select. |

## Solution

### Code

```ts title="1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores"
export const minimumDifference = (nums: number[], k: number): number => {
  nums.sort((x, y) => x - y)
  let minimum = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
  const n = nums.length
  for (let i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
    minimum = Math.min(minimum, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i])
  }
  return minimum
}
```

```ts
// Expected: 2
minimumDifference([1, 3, 6, 9], 2)

// Expected: 0
minimumDifference([1, 1, 1, 1], 2)
```
