# 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores â€“ Easy

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` representing student scores and an integer `k`.

Select any group of `k` students and return the **minimum difference** between the highest and lowest scores within that group.

### Example

```ts
// Expected: 2
minimumDifference([1, 3, 6, 9], 2)

// Expected: 0
minimumDifference([1, 1, 1, 1], 2)
```

## Objective

Find the group of k scores in nums such that the difference between the maximum and minimum in that group is as small as possible.

## Approach

This is a two-pointers / sliding window over a sorted array problem.

### Intuition

The difference between the highest and lowest values in a group is minimized when those values are as close as possible. Since the array can contain values in any order, we need to sort it first.

Then, the best way to find such a group of k values is to:

- Sort nums
- Slide a window of size k over the array
- Track the minimum difference between the first and last element of each window

### Strategy

- Sort the array nums in ascending order.
- Iterate from index 0 to n - k:
  - For each window, compute the difference: nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]
  - Track the minimum difference found
- Return the minimum.

### Code

```ts title="1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores"
export const minimumDifference = (nums: number[], k: number): number => {
  nums.sort((x, y) => x - y)
  let minimum = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
  const n = nums.length
  for (let i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
    minimum = Math.min(minimum, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i])
  }
  return minimum
}
```

### Time Complexity

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(n log n)      | O(1)             |
