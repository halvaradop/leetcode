# 344. Reverse String – Easy

## Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must modify the array **in-place** using **O(1)** extra memory.

### Example

```ts
// Expected output: ["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]
reverseString(["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"])
```

## Objective

Reverse the input character array in-place. That is, reorder the array such that the first character becomes the last, the second becomes the second-to-last, and so on.

## Approach

This is a classic two-pointer problem — commonly used when needing to swap elements from both ends of a sequence.

### Intuition

To reverse a string in-place, we simply swap characters from the start with characters from the end until we meet in the middle.

We use two pointers:

- left → starts at index 0 (beginning of the array)
- right → starts at index n - 1 (end of the array)

On each iteration, we swap s[left] with s[right], then move left forward and right backward. We stop when left >= right.

Since we are only swapping characters, the space complexity remains constant at O(1).

### Visualization

We continue this way until we reach the end of the array.

### Code

```ts title="344. Reverse String"
export const reverseString = (str: string[]): void => {
  const n = str.length
  let left = 0
  let right = n - 1
  while (left < right) {
    const swap = str[left]
    str[left++] = str[right]
    str[right--] = swap
  }
}
```

### Time Complexity

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(n)            | O(1)             |
