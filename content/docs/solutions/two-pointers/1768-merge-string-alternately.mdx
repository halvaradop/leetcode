# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

## Description

Given two strings, merge them by alternating characters from each string, starting with the first string. If one string is longer, append the remaining characters at the end.

| Parameter | Type   | Description                 |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| word1     | string | The first string to merge.  |
| word2     | string | The second string to merge. |

## Solution

### Code

```ts title="1768. Merge Strings Alternately"
export const mergeAlternately = (word1: string, word2: string): string => {
  let idx1 = 0
  let idx2 = 0
  let merge = ""
  const n = word1.length
  const m = word2.length
  while (idx1 < n || idx2 < m) {
    if (idx1 < n) {
      merge += word1[idx1++]
    }
    if (idx2 < m) {
      merge += word2[idx2++]
    }
  }
  return merge
}
```

```ts
// Expected: "apbqrc"
mergeAlternately("abc", "pqr")

// Expected: "abpqrs"
mergeAlternately("ab", "pqrs")
```

### Time Complexity

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| O(n + m)        | O(1)             |
